## Annual Healthcare Expenses in the US
### Description: 
This map catalogs the annual healthcare expenses in the US states per capita. Expenses are calculated including hospitals, physicians’ and dentists’ services, prescription drugs, eyeglasses, and nursing home care. This figure is calculated including expenses paid by insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and private citizens. 
### Functions: 
The map uses graduated circle symbology to represent the relative spending of each state. Interactions include popups which display the state name, per capita spending, and a numeric rank: with #1 being the highest spending and #50 being the lowest. The circle symbology combined with a ranking system helps the user to visualise and compare the statistics of each state.
